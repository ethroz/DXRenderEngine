# DXRenderEngine
A real-time render engine that uses the DirectX 11 graphics API. Includes rasterization and ray tracing engine models. Rasterization has point light shadows, and post processing. Ray tracing uses spherical bounding volumes to work on ALL GPUs with reflections and refractions. Both engine models use the Cook-Torrance Reflectance Model for object lighting.
